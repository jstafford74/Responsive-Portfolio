        <p>Born and raised on Air Force Bases, my parents are both retired Air Force officers, veterans and met
            working at Cheyenne Mountain Air Station in Colorado. As a finance graduate of the Carrol School of
            Management at Boston College, I immediately pursued a career in finance with a focus in derivatives.
            Having worked on the open-outcry trading floors, at hedge funds and sell-side institutions I have
            interacted in numerous market structures, environments and asset classes. Financial risk management
            has always been a focus, from plain vanilla market risk to the more complex world of derivatives
            that span market, credit and interest rates.

            In 2017 I started working with a medical device startup company that is focused on noninvasive ways
            to detect blood glucose, and am currently working as a business development lead, project manager
            and data analyst for a dermatologist practice in Stamford, CT that is also focused on noninvasive
            solutions to treat skin cancer.</p>
